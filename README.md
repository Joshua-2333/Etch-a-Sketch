# Etch-a-Sketch
Using all I've learned up to this point.
We will be using CSS and JavaScript.
As well as showing our DOM manipulation skills.
We want to create a 16x16 grid of square divs.
Have buttons for different affects such as changing the color, randomize the color, erase, adding a grid, and shading.
As well implementing a slider to change the size of the grid.
